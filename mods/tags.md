# Tags

To help people find and download your Geode mod on the in-game Download tab, it has to be easily findable through a category or certain type of mods. Well, worry no more because this can be done through the Tags system! Using this system, you can add keywords to your mod listing, and it can be found using Geode's search filters.

While you can make your own tag by writing a new keyword in the tags of your mod, it is highly recommended that you use an already established tag to prevent unnecessary tags being added, and to allow for a more organized Search Filters page.

## Add Tags to your mod

In your mod listing's `entry.json`, you should add a section like this:
```json
    "tags": [
        "Player",
        "Editor",
        "Online"
    ]
```

Once your mod is approved and added to the index, the listing should look something like this:
