# Tags

In Geometry Dash, there are tags you can use for things such as `FLAlertLayer`, `DialogLayer`, or `MDPopup`...

Let's learn how to use these tags:

## Color

In Geometry Dash, there are color tags, which change the color of text. Below is an example using some of these color tags:

| **Tag** | **Color Code** | **Example**                           |
|---------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| `<cb>`  | `0x4A52E1`     | <p style="color: #4A52E1;">Sample</p> |
| `<cg>`  | `0x40E348`     | <p style="color: #40E348;">Sample</p> |
| `<cl>`  | `0x60ABEF`     | <p style="color: #60ABEF;">Sample</p> |
| `<cj>`  | `0x32C8FF`     | <p style="color: #32C8FF;">Sample</p> |
| `<cy>`  | `0xFFFF00`     | <p style="color: #FFFF00;">Sample</p> |
| `<co>`  | `0xFF5A4B`     | <p style="color: #FF5A4B;">Sample</p> |
| `<cr>`  | `0xFF5A5A`     | <p style="color: #FF5A5A;">Sample</p> |
| `<cp>`  | `0xFF00FF`     | <p style="color: #FF00FF;">Sample</p> |
| `<ca>`  | `0x9632FF`     | <p style="color: #9632FF;">Sample</p> |
| `<cd>`  | `0xFF96FF`     | <p style="color: #FF96FF;">Sample</p> |
| `<cc>`  | `0xFFFF96`     | <p style="color: #FFFF96;">Sample</p> |
| `<cf>`  | `0x96FFFF`     | <p style="color: #96FFFF;">Sample</p> |
| `<cs>`  | `0xFFDC41`     | <p style="color: #FFDC41;">Sample</p> |
| `<c_>`  | `0xFF0000`     | <p style="color: #FF0000;">Sample</p> |

To use these tags, follow the syntax below:

```
"Welcome to my red <cr>lair</c>! As you can see, my <cg>things</c> are green, and my <cb>doorframe</c> is blue! Why? That's up to <co>Rob</c><cj>Top</c> to answer!"
```

By using `</c>`, you are closing the tag. `</c>` closes all color tags.

## Delay

In Geometry Dash, there are also delay tags to wait a certain amount of centiseconds (1/100 of a second) before more text appearing. Below is an example:

```
Wait!<d040> You shouldn't go there<d500>.<d500>.<d500>.
```

In the `<d...>` tag, the number next to the `<d` specifies the number of centiseconds to wait. This number must be 3 digits. This is how it looks like in-game (GIF from GDDocs):

## Shake

Shake tags make text shake. Below is an example:

```
<co>I HAVE SAID TOO MUCH! QUICKLY TO THE <s260>CHOPPER!</s></c>
```

In the `<s...>` tag, the number next to the `<s` specifies the intensity of the shaking. For reference, this is how it looks like in-game (GIF from GDDocs):

# Instant/Fade

Fade Tags are used to fade in a block of text on screen instead of making it appear character by character. Similarly to colour tags, Fade tags have a start and end tag to denote which piece of text should appear instantly. The number is specified in centiseconds, which is 1/100th of a second.

Usage: `Hello, <i100>world!</i>`
